 # Challenge
 
 Mr. Gordon was at IKEA a few weeks ago and noticed this pattern:
 
 ![pattern.jpg](pattern.jpg "pattern")
 
 Use any of the concepts you have learned so far in this course to reproduce the wallpaper pattern shown above.
 
 - note: The photo was not taken "straight on" against the wall, so the image has perspective.  You do not need to reproduce that part of the image.  In other words, no need to create the appearance of "depth", just reproduce colours and shapes.
 
 - callout(Hint): Look for elements of repetition in the pattern. Try to reproduce a portion of the image, then simply *repeat* the pattern.
